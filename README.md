# open-invite

I am excited to be part of the Open Leaders Program and look forward to learning how to design and lead in the open! 

# Project Name: OpenInvite

# For who? 

Non-technical people or anyone who wants to contribute to an open source project!
Goal: Create a document for anyone to learn and contribute to technical projects

# Vision: 

Iâ€™m working with contributors to create source for non-technical volunteers so that they can connect and contribute to open source projects to actively drive open source projects. I am working in the open because I want to source and connect non-technical volunteers to help drive projects forward and drive diversity of thinking on technical projects.

I am excited to create a way for anyone (elementary student, non-technical professional, to new internet user) to contribute to an open source project. I want to make it simple and accessable for anyone who has an internet connect to feel like they can be part of something really important even if they do not have technical skills or a programming background. 

# Would you like to be part of this exciting project? 

You can help by contributing to the Open Canvas, and the building of the guide or inviting users who may be interested in contributing to open source!
